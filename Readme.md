# **Good Tape Code Test** 🧪😳

Welcome, dear candidate, to the Good Tape Code Test!

Crafting a meaningful test in the age of AI is a challenge, but we’re embracing it by focusing on what makes **you** unique. This isn’t about perfect answers; it’s about your **process**, **understanding**, and how you bring your ideas to life.

### What We Value:

- **Creative Use of AI**: Save time on repetitive tasks and focus on the fun, complex parts of the problem. Use AI as a tool, not a crutch.
- **Documentation & Assumptions**: Explain your thought process, document your choices, and tell us why you took the approach you did.
- **Understanding**: Show us you understand the tools and technologies you’re using and can explain them confidently.
- **Expressiveness**: We want to see how you solve challenges and express yourself in code.

## **The Test**

### **Main Quest**

1. **Voice-Activated Dad Joke Search Engine**
   - Build a web app where users can **speak a query** and get **dad jokes** in response.
   - Use any free dad-joke API of your choice. This one for example: [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).
   - Support **voice input** using browser APIs (e.g., Web Speech API).
   - Transcribe the voice input to text using the [Good Tape API](https://api.goodtape.io/docs). You should have gotten an API key in your email.

### **Sidequests**

Choose **three sidequests** to complete:
(We expect you to pick sidequests that complement the role you are applying for, your competencies and interests.)

1. **Styling Challenge**

   - Design and implement a **themed UI** for your app.
   - Make sure it’s fully responsive and accessible.
   - Explain your design choices.

2. **Dynamic Jokes Filter**

   - Add a feature that allows users to filter jokes by **length**, **category**, or **rating** (if supported by the API or your backend).
   - Explain how you handle edge cases, like unsupported filters.
  
3. **Joke Semantic search**
   - Embed the jokes with an embedding model of your choice(we won't judge the quality of embeddings)
   - Implement a vector search for the embeddings and make the joke search semantic.
  
4. **Containarize and orchestrate**
   - Containarize your app and other dependencies
   - Make a orchestration in a tool of your choice that dictates how the different services interact and should be deployed.

5. **Database Feature**

   - Store a history of searches and joke results using a simple backend.
   - Use **Postgres** or **MongoDB** (or both if you’re feeling adventurous).
   - Document your schema design.

6. **Custom Feature**
   - Add a feature of your choice that makes the app more useful, delightful, or enthusiastically stupid.
   - Tell us why you chose this feature and how you built it.

### **Submission Guidelines**

- **Document**: Include a README file explaining your setup process, key decisions, and assumptions.
- **Keep it Simple**: This doesn’t need to be a production-ready app. We’re looking for clear, understandable code.
- **Code Ownership**: Use version control (Git) to demonstrate how you manage your codebase.

---

### **What We’re Excited to See**:

- Your ability to think through problems and articulate solutions.
- How you use tools and technologies like **React**, **TypeScript**, **CSS**, **Node.js**, and more.
- Clean, modular, and expressive code.

Let your creativity shine, and have fun! We’re excited to see what you’ll create.

Good luck! 🎉
